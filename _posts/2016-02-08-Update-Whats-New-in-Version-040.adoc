= Update: What's New in Version 0.4.0
:hp-tags: release

It's been a year since HubPress launched. How time flies!

1,976 forks.

2,205 stars.

An https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/README.adoc[english] README translated in https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/README-es.adoc[spanish], https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/README-zh.adoc[chinese] and https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/README-ja.adoc[japanese].

Hundreds of progressive blogs using HubPress and Asciidoctor to write scaleable content, in an easy-to-use product. 

Best of all, it's totally free!

== Material design

To give HubPress a modern, progressive User Interface, we've redesigned it using the Material design template.

This provides an even better responsive design for mobile users, and provides a clean interface for new and existing bloggers.

[[Development]]
== Development process

HubPress is moving away from developing in the https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io[hubpress.io] repository. 
To ensure the hubpress.io repository remains clean for new adopters, development has shifted to https://github.com/HubPress/dev.hubpress.io[dev.hubpress.io].

The process to commit a change to HubPress is changed to the following:

. Create an issue on the https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/issues[HubPress/hubpress.io] repository describing the change you propose.
. Fork https://github.com/HubPress/dev.hubpress.io to make changes in the new development repository.
. Switch to the `/development` branch.
. Create a branch from `/development` in your forked repo. 
+
NOTE: We suggest naming the branch using the format `issue-nnn` to make it easy to refer to the issue.
+
. Open a Pull Request (PR), and summarise your changes, linking to the issue you created.

Once we receive your PR, we'll review your changes and then either accept them or ask for further changes before final acceptance.

The new repository is backed by Continuous Integration tasks provisioned through Travis-CI, which trigger automatically once a change to `/development` is detected.

It's a more scalable way to manage HubPress moving forward.

== Themes

HubPress uses the professional-looking Ghost themes to allow you to personalise your Blog. It's been a year since release, so it's time for a couple of new looks. 

uno-zen::
  This theme, created by https://twitter.com/kikobeats[Kiko Beats], is a simplified theme you can use for a more "docs-site" looking blog:
  * Great for long-form blogs, 
  * Looks great with pinned posts.

ghostium::
  This theme, created by https://twitter.com/oswaldoacauan[Oswaldo Acauan], is focused on content and based on Medium:
  * Makes your content the star of the page, 
  * Fully responsive.

== Documentation 

The documentation for HubPress has undergone a bit of a face-lift as well.

The README.adoc was becoming more of a User's Guide and less a terse overview about getting started with the product.

For this reason, the documentation has been separated out into the following documents:

https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/README.adoc[README.adoc]::
  Just the basics of getting HubPress forked, and set up. Nothing else.
https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/Administration.adoc[Administration.adoc]::
  This guide helps you get your blog customised to your individual requirements.
https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io/blob/master/Writers_Guide.adoc[Writers_Guide.adoc]::
  If you are new to HubPress or AsciiDoc, this guide will help you write your first post like a professional. 
  
Further improvements to the HubPress documentation set are planned, including:

* a Contributors guide to help theme developers and other contributors successfully develop for the platform.
* improvements to the documentation, including incorporating community feedback.

If you see an improvement to documentation that requires action, follow the <<Development>> steps above.
