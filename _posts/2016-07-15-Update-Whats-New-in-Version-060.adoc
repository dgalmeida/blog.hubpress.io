== HubPress supports RSS!

RSS feed is now available at the url `<url_of_your_blog>/rss`!
It is rebuild when:

* you publish a post,
* you change the content of a published post,
* you unpublish a post,
* you change your settings.

In the past we have removed the RSS link on each theme because RSS was not available, themes have been updated and links are here.

== Upgrades are simpler with a link

You can find a new item in the main menu, *Check for upgrade*:

It will redirect you to {url_github}[GitHub] and you will be able to upgrade your instance in the right way.

We also have added the version add the bottom of the main menu:

== Bugs...

We have fixed two bugs:

* a problem with the pagination when you use the branch `gh-pages` without a CNAME,
* a typo that broke the theme *Saga*

We hope you enjoy this new release. 
If you have any ideas for features, or see a problem with this release, we would love your {url_issues}[feedback]!
